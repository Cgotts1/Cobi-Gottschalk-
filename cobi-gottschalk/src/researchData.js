      projectSummary: "This study focuses on the sexually dimorphic shape differences of the proximal male and female femur and their relationship in size between the acetabulum of the pelvis and the femoral head. The research demonstrates high correlation and potential benefits in the identification of human skeletal remains, particularly in cases involving commingled remains, further advancing scientific understanding of the femur and pelvis.",

        projectSummary: "This research aimed to investigate whether pollen present in soil, transferred onto clothing, could still be detected after washing. After applying soil containing pollen to denim fabric and subjecting it to multiple wash cycles, the study revealed that even after three standard wash cycles, pollen traces remained on the fabric, providing valuable insights for law enforcement and archaeologists regarding the persistence of pollen on clothing.",
