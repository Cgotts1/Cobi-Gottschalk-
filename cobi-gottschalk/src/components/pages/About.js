          With a Master of Science degree in forensic anthropology from
          Liverpool John Moores University and a Bachelor of Arts degree in
          anthropology from California State University, Northridge, my
          educational background in anthropology is well-rounded. I have
          expertise in both qualitative and quantitative research methods.
          Furthermore, I have expanded my skill set through a comprehensive full
          stack coding bootcamp at UCSD, where I gained practical experience and
          sharpened my abilities in software development and web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my time at the bootcamp, I learned how to build responsive and
          user-friendly web applications, as well as how to collaborate with
          other developers using Git version control. Drawing from my previous
          experience as a high school art teacher, I also applied my insights
          into user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design principles to
          develop web applications with intuitive and visually appealing
          interfaces, ensuring a seamless experience for end-users. I gained
          hands-on experience with various programming languages such as HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript, and became proficient in using the MERN (MongoDB,
          Express, React, Node.js) stack, which is widely used in modern web
          development. Overall, my combination of skills in anthropology and
          software development make me a well-rounded and versatile candidate
          for a variety of roles in both fields.
